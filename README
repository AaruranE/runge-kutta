to solve systems of ODEs.

Warning: It won't help you gaining world domination!


Installation
------------

Just run the following with sufficient privileges (e. g. as root):

$ python setup.py install


Usage
-----

In order to run one of the example simulations,
just execute the particular file:

$ python damped_oscillation.py

Plotting the output using Gnuplot:

$ python damped_oscillation.py > /tmp/do.dat

$ gnuplot
gnuplot> plot '/tmp/do.dat' using 1:3
